**Key Points**

During the development of the website, we always focused on the following points that we consider crucial for a good website:

* The structure of the website must be **simple** and easy to remember. Users should be able to build a mental map of the website in a few minutes;
* The links connecting pages should be as **intuitive** as possible. Users should understand what they are reaching _before_ clicking the link.
